                <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Today, dogs are one of the most beloved pets and are valued for their loyalty, companionship, and various working roles including service animals.</p>
