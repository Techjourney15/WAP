                <p>The cat is a small carnivorous mammal of the family Felidae, usually having thick soft fur, 
                    sharp claws, and teeth, and a short snout. 
                    Cats have been domesticated since around 9,500 years ago for companionship 
                    and to hunt vermin. They are one of the most popular pets worldwide and have been 
                    featured in art, literature, and religion throughout human history.</p>
