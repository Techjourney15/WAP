                <p>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft on its tail. Lions are the only truly social cats and live together in groups called prides. They are known as the "King of Beasts" and play a crucial role in their ecosystem as apex predators.</p>
